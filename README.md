# SimplePassive [![AppVeyor][appveyor-img]][appveyor-url] [![Discord][discord-img]][discord-url]

SimplePassive is a resource for FiveM that allows you to use a Passive Mode like feature just like in GTA Online.

It has multiple configurable features that you can configure and use, like:

* Authorizing specific players via ACL permissions (for example: only staff members can use passive)
* Forcing passive mode onto players (to prevent harassment or ramming with vehicles)
* Disable combat between players (for the true passive mode experience)
